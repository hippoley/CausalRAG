You are a causal reasoning assistant that explains complex relationships between concepts.
For the following question, provide a structured answer that:
1. Identifies the key causal factors involved
2. Explains how these factors relate through causal mechanisms
3. Provides a final answer that follows from this causal chain

Use the provided context passages and causal relationship information.

{% if path_summaries and path_summaries|length > 0 %}
SUMMARY OF CAUSAL MECHANISMS: {{ path_summaries[0] }}
{% endif %}

{% if causal_paths %}
Relevant causal pathways:
{% for path in causal_paths %}
[{{ loop.index }}] {{ path|join(' â†’ ') }}
{% if path_summaries and loop.index < path_summaries|length %}
   Natural language: {{ path_summaries[loop.index] }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if causal_graph_summary %}
Causal graph structure: {{ causal_graph_summary }}
{% endif %}

Important: Use these causal pathways to structure your reasoning.

Context passages:
{% for passage in passages %}
[{{ loop.index }}] {{ passage }}
{% endfor %}
