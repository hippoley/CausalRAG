## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CausalRAG.git
cd CausalRAG

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Install for development
pip install -e .

```

### Quick Example

```python
from causalrag import CausalRAGPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = CausalRAGPipeline()

# Index your documents (builds both vector index and causal graph)
documents = [
    "Climate change causes rising sea levels, which leads to coastal flooding.",
    "Deforestation reduces carbon capture, increasing atmospheric CO2.",
    "Higher CO2 levels accelerate global warming, exacerbating climate change.",
    "Coastal flooding damages infrastructure and causes population displacement.",
    "Climate policies aim to reduce emissions, thereby mitigating climate change effects."
]
pipeline.index(documents)

# Query the system
result = pipeline.run("What are the consequences of climate change?")
print(result["answer"])

# Access supporting information
print("\nRelevant causal paths:")
for path in result["causal_paths"]:
    print(" → ".join(path))

print("\nSupporting contexts:")
for ctx in result["context"]:
    print(f"- {ctx[:100]}...")
```

## 🖥️ Command Line Interface

CausalRAG provides a convenient CLI for common operations:

```bash
# Display help information
python -m causalrag.cli --help

# Index a directory of documents
python -m causalrag.cli index --input docs/ --output index/

# Query an existing index
python -m causalrag.cli query --index index/ --query "What causes coastal flooding?"

# Start the API server
python -m causalrag.cli serve --index index/ --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## 🧩 Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Causal Graph Builder** | Extracts causal triples from text and constructs a directed acyclic graph |
| **Causal Path Retriever** | Finds causal paths relevant to the query |
| **Reranker** | Prioritizes documents based on causal relevance |
| **Vector Store** | Provides semantic similarity search capability |
| **Hybrid Retriever** | Combines vector search with causal graph search |
| **Prompt Builder** | Creates LLM prompts with causal context |
| **LLM Interface** | Connects to language models for generation |
| **Pipeline** | Orchestrates the entire process from query to answer |

## 💡 How It Works

CausalRAG enhances traditional RAG with causal reasoning in four key steps:

1. **Causal Graph Construction**: 
   - Extract causal triples (A→B relationships) from documents
   - Build a connected graph of causal relationships
   - Store embeddings of causal concepts for semantic matching

2. **Hybrid Retrieval**:
   - Perform standard vector similarity search
   - Identify causally relevant concepts to the query
   - Combine both signals to retrieve candidate passages

3. **Causal Reranking**:
   - Score passages based on presence of causally relevant concepts
   - Prioritize passages that preserve causal path structure
   - Select top passages that contain both relevance and causal coherence

4. **Informed Generation**:
   - Augment prompt with explicit causal paths
   - Guide LLM to respect causal relationships in generation
   - Produce answers that follow valid causal chains

## 🔌 Integration Options

CausalRAG can be used in multiple ways:

### Standalone QA System
```python
from causalrag import CausalRAGPipeline

pipeline = CausalRAGPipeline()
pipeline.index(documents)
result = pipeline.run("What causes coastal flooding?")
```

### Plugin for Existing RAG
```python
from causalrag.reranker import CausalPathReranker
from causalrag.causal_graph import CausalGraphBuilder, CausalPathRetriever

# Build graph
builder = CausalGraphBuilder()
builder.index_documents(documents)

# Setup reranker
retriever = CausalPathRetriever(builder)
reranker = CausalPathReranker(retriever)

# Use in your existing RAG pipeline
candidates = your_existing_retriever.retrieve(query)
reranked_candidates = reranker.rerank(query, candidates)
```

### API Service
```bash
# Start the server
python -m causalrag.cli serve --index your_index_dir/ --port 8000

# In another application:
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "What are the effects of climate change?", "top_k": 5}'
```

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

```python
# Create pipeline with custom settings
from causalrag import create_pipeline

pipeline = create_pipeline(
    model_name="gpt-4",
    embedding_model="text-embedding-ada-002",
    graph_path="saved/my_causal_graph.json",  # Load pre-built graph
    config_path="config/custom_settings.json"  # Custom configuration
)

# Configure causal vs. semantic weights
pipeline.hybrid_retriever.semantic_weight = 0.3
pipeline.hybrid_retriever.causal_weight = 0.7

# Adjust reranker settings
pipeline.reranker.node_match_weight = 1.2
pipeline.reranker.path_match_weight = 2.0

# Change prompt template style
pipeline.prompt_builder = PromptBuilder(template_style="structured")
```

## 🧠 Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Vector Search Optimization**:
   - Use `faiss-gpu` on CUDA-enabled systems for faster similarity search
   - Consider dimensionality reduction for large document collections

2. **Causal Graph Efficiency**:
   - Set appropriate confidence thresholds to filter weak causal relationships
   - Use `min_node_length` parameter to avoid short, common words as nodes

3. **Memory Management**:
   - For large document collections, use batch processing during indexing
   - Consider saving and loading the causal graph and vector index separately

4. **API Performance**:
   - Implement caching for frequent queries
   - Use background workers for indexing large document collections

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: How many documents can CausalRAG handle?
A: CausalRAG can handle thousands of documents, but performance may decrease with very large collections. For best results with 100K+ documents, consider sharding your index or using a database backend.

### Q: Does CausalRAG work with languages other than English?
A: While the core system works with any language supported by the underlying embedding model, causal extraction works best with English text. Multilingual support is on our roadmap.

### Q: What LLM providers are supported?
A: CausalRAG supports OpenAI models by default, but can be configured to work with Anthropic Claude, local models via LM Studio API, and any model with an OpenAI-compatible API.

### Q: How does CausalRAG handle conflicting causal information?
A: When conflicting causal relationships are detected, CausalRAG assigns confidence scores and prioritizes relationships with higher confidence. These conflicts are also exposed in the prompt for the LLM to resolve.
